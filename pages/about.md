# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin. I have a passion for learning and look to always improve myself. I am interested in robotics and aerospace but always open to exploring new experiences in other industries. Currently I am seeking an internship or possibly full time position starting in May 2025.
